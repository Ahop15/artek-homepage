We are by your side at every stage with our engineering perspective and sectoral experience.

- Market need and competitive advantage assessment
- Identification of technical risks and uncertainties

deliverables, timeline, and success criteria in program-specific formats, creating a complete application file.

- Definition of project objectives and goals
- Work packages and activity planning
- Technical and scientific content writing
- Determination of deliverables and success indicators
- Completion of application forms and file submission

### Budget Planning

We create a realistic and fundable budget suitable for project activities. We plan personnel, materials, service procurement, travel,
and other expense items in accordance with program rules and prepare cost justifications.

- Identification and classification of expense items
- Control of program budget limits
- Cost justification documents
- Co-financing and cash contribution planning

### Project Management and Reporting

preparing for audit processes, and project closure procedures.

## How Does the Process Work?

We evaluate your project idea and identify the most suitable support program. Then we prepare the technical content, budget planning, and
application file together. We monitor the post-application process and continue our support during project management and reporting phases upon approval.

Each support program has its own evaluation criteria, budget limits, and reporting requirements.
Therefore, selecting the right program and structuring the project content appropriately before application is critically important.
