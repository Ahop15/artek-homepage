## General Information

With the changes made within the scope of the R&D Reform Package, which was enacted and published in the Official
Gazette on February 26, 2016, many regulations have been introduced to develop our country's R&D and innovation
ecosystem, primarily Law No. 5746 on Supporting Research, Development and Design Activities.

At the forefront of these regulations is the inclusion of design activities within the scope of support, just like R&D
activities. As a result, the production of high value-added technological products will be realized. Within the scope of
this law, the concept of Design Centers has been introduced into legislation, and many important supports have been
provided to Design Centers.

Private Sector Design Centers are established and operate within the scope of Law No. 5746, which was prepared with the
understanding that investments made in design, technology and human resources return as technological advancement, high
competitiveness and high welfare level.
