    "question": "Is it mandatory to use a consultancy service to establish an R&D or Design Center?",
    "answer": "No, working with any consultancy firm is not mandatory for R&D or Design Center applications. You can submit your application directly to the Ministry of Industry and Technology yourself. However, the process involves technical details such as building a project portfolio, personnel competency assessment, physical infrastructure requirements, and application documentation. Consultancy support ensures these processes are built on solid foundations and potential deficiencies are identified in advance."

  {
    "question": "What is the scope of your technical consultancy?",
    "answer": "We provide consultancy for all processes requiring engineering knowledge and technical expertise. This includes R&D and Design Center establishment processes, TÜBİTAK/KOSGEB/Development Agency project preparation and management, technical feasibility studies, process and system design, project documentation, and corporate technical training. Financial advisory, accounting, tax calculations, legal consultancy, or human resources management are outside our scope — we work complementarily with your existing advisors in these areas."

  {
    "question": "What does academic credibility mean?",
    "answer": "R&D and innovation are, by definition, activities based on scientific methods. Identifying the technological uncertainty and innovation aspects of your projects requires an academic perspective. At ARTEK, thanks to our academic background and knowledge base, we can evaluate your projects on their scientific foundations and coordinate university-industry collaboration opportunities more effectively. This perspective strengthens the technical consistency of your projects, especially during audit processes and project evaluations."

  {
    "question": "Can you work remotely?",
    "answer": "Yes, we can conduct most of our services remotely. Project evaluation, documentation support, and training can be done online. For situations such as physical infrastructure assessment or on-site training, we schedule site visits when necessary."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does your service pricing work?",
    "answer": "We work on a project basis or consultancy duration basis. After evaluating your needs in the initial meeting, we clarify the scope and fee. Our initial introductory meeting is free of charge."
